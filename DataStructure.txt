Github Social Network Analysis Project

Description:
This project involves analyzing a large social network of GitHub developers. The data was collected from the public API in June 2019. Nodes represent developers who have starred at least 10 repositories, and edges represent mutual follower relationships between them. The vertex features are extracted based on the location, repositories starred, employer, and e-mail address.

Data source:
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/github-social.html

Properties:
- Directed: No
- Node features: Yes
- Edge features: No
- Node labels: Yes (Binary-labeled)
- Temporal: No
- Nodes: 37,700
- Edges: 289,003
- Density: 0.001
- Transitivity: 0.013

Files:
- raw_data/musae_git_edges.csv: Contains the edges of the graph
- raw_data/musae_git_target.csv: Contains the target labels for the nodes
- raw_data/musae_git_features.json: Contains the features for the nodes

Scripts:
- DataStructure.py: Contains functions to load edges, targets, features, and construct the graph
- DataSampling.py: Contains functions for sampling the graph and saving the sampled data

Possible Tasks:
- Binary node classification
- Link prediction
- Community detection
- Network visualization
